# Welcome to Code-portal

The idea is to make a very performant, feature-rich, real-time code collaboration platform.
Users should be able to create a quick coding session, and then let their friends join in, using the generated share link!
No logins, no registration, (almost) no servers...

Let's beat google docs, by trading in document persistance for performance in the form of tons of concurrent users and extremely quick document updates.

### Who is this for?

Here are my favorite use cases:
  - Code tutoring! Connect coders for the purpose of education, T.A.'s, or if you want help learning to code, reach out to me directly!
  - Coding competitions! - there might actually exist times when pair programming is a good thing!
  - Coding interviews!
  - you name it!
  
This may not be suited for full fledge projects, but I can see it being very useful in the world of education.
